Download the Necessary Files:

- Make sure you have the mastermind.py file, which contains functions related to the Mastermind game.

Review the Code:

- Familiarize yourself with the provided code. It defines classes for individuals in the genetic algorithm and the GA solver itself.

Initialize the Solver:

- Import the GASolver class from the provided code.
- Create an instance of the GASolver class.

Reset the Population:

-Use the reset_population method of the solver to initialize the population of individuals.

Evolve the Population:

- Use the evolve_for_one_generation method to evolve the population for one generation.
- Use the evolve_until method to evolve the population until a certain condition is met, such as a maximum number of generations or a threshold fitness level.

Get the Best Individual:

- Use the get_best_individual method to retrieve the best individual found by the genetic algorithm.
