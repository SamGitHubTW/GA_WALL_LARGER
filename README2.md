Download the Necessary Files:

- Download the cities.py file that contains functions related to cities and roads.
- Make sure to have the cities.txt file which contains the data about the cities.

Initialize the Solver:

- Import the GASolver class from the provided code.
- Create an instance of the GASolver class.

Reset the Population:

- Use the reset_population method of the solver to initialize the population of individuals. Pass the city_dict and optionally specify the population size.

Evolve Until a Condition:

- Use the evolve_until method to evolve the population until a maximum number of generations or a threshold fitness level is reached. Pass the city_dict, maximum number of generations, and the threshold fitness level.

Get the Best Individual:

-Use the get_best_individual method to retrieve the best individual found by the genetic algorithm.

Visualize the Solution:

The cities.draw_cities function can be used to visualize the best solution found by the algorithm.
